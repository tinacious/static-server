## Features

- No external dependencies are used. The project leverages native Go packages only.
- No external runtime dependencies. Some CLI tools require you to have a specific version of Node.js, Python or another language, this does not.
- Multi-platform: Thanks to Go, this works on macOS, Windows and Linux


## Installation

### Install using Go

If you have Go lang tooling installed, this is the way that is recommended since it will build the binary for your architecture and make it executable.

Install the CLI tool using `go install`:

```sh
go install github.com/tinacious/static-server@latest
```

### Install manually

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/tinacious/static-server/releases) page and download the appropriate release for your operating system and architecture.

Put the file somewhere on your executables path, e.g. I use `~/.local/bin`.

On macOS, you will need to trust the executable after the first run attempt in your **System Preferences &rarr; Privacy & Security** settings.


## Usage

Run the `static-server` command in any directory you'd like to serve as a web server.

If you have the following directory `test`:

```
test
├── index.html
└── style.css
```

You can do:

```sh
cd test
static-server
```

This should serve the contents on a random port. 


### Custom port

You can configure the port by passing it as an environment variable. For example, to run on port 1337 run:

```sh
PORT=1337 static-server
```


## Uninstall

To uninstall it, simply delete the executable `static-server`.

If you installed it with Go, you can navigate to either `$GOPATH/bin` (if your `$GOPATH` is defined) or  `~/go/bin` and delete it from there.

If you installed it manually, e.g. in `~/.local/bin`, delete it from there.
